<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Earth Defence Force: Elite Asteroid Division is based on the popular arcade game from the 1980s called Missile Command by Atari Inc. The concept of the arcade game EDF:EAD, is for the player to stop the asteroids that rain from the sky from destroying the cities below. The player will be able to stop the asteroids from hitting the cities by firing a missile directly at the asteroid to be destroyed before hitting the cities. The game is played by moving the mouse and clicking on the anticipated location of the asteroids and firing a missile directly at the asteroids. The game has a scoring system: 100 points are gained for each asteroid shot down, 100 points are lost for each city hit, and 300 points are lost for each city destroyed. This scoring system is enhanced with a high scores system as well. After each game, a locally-saved file is read and checked to see if the most recent game has set a new high score. It updates the file if necessary, and displays the high score screen. The game also features difficulty modes: easy, medium and hard, which change how many shots the player can fire at once as well as the frequency that the meteors rain down. Pressing the escape key during gameplay pauses the game and brings up the menu, and pressing it at the menu closes the game. </span></p>
